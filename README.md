# React + Vite
Add at least 3 Project features
1. You can add course in cart
2. You can't add credit more than 20
3. You can also see remaining credit hour.
Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

In my React project:

I have used the useState hook to initialize and manage state.
State variables include cart, credit, and totalRemaining.
State updates occur based on user interactions and conditions.
Toast notifications from 'react-toastify' provide user feedback.
State data is passed to child components for rendering.
